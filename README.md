# python3_examples

**Open project to play around with easy code.**

I have spent a lot of time over the past 2 years with Python and the available documentation on the internet.
Now it is time to find applications for the theory.
In between, I'm already trying out the possibilities a bit. In the process, code snippets emerge that might be of interest to beginners.
The scripts are far from perfect, but they mostly serve the purpose. 
If you want to correct mistakes or show improvements, you are very welcome to contribute.

## mmClone
The first programme is a number guessing game. Inspired by 'Mastermind', the player has to guess a 5-digit number code. After each attempt, the player receives hints to help him guess. Developed with Python 3.9, it runs in the console. 

## textgen
Inspired by the Markov text composer, I developed a Lorem Ipsum generator with charm.
The texts I used I got from Project Gutenberg. The GUI version works according to my ideas.
