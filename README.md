# python3_examples

**Open project to play around with easy code.**

I have spent a lot of time over the past 2 years with Python and the available documentation on the internet.
Now it is time to find applications for the theory.
In between, I'm already trying out the possibilities a bit. In the process, code snippets emerge that might be of interest to beginners.
The scripts are far from perfect, but they mostly serve the purpose. 
If you want to correct mistakes or show improvements, you are very welcome to contribute.

## mmClone
The first programme is a number guessing game. Inspired by 'Mastermind', the player has to guess a 5-digit number code. After each attempt, the player receives hints to help him guess. Developed with Python 3.9, it runs in the console. 

## textgen
Inspired by the Markov text composer, I developed a Lorem Ipsum generator with charm.
The texts I used I got from Project Gutenberg. The GUI version works according to my ideas. 

## garage
Implementation of a task from a job interview. A proposed solution in Python 3.
Vehicles with four and two wheels search for a parking space in a parking garage. The script should facilitate the management and provide information about the occupancy. I have added the task as text.

## boerse
A little stock market game in the terminal. I got the suggestion from an old board game from my youth.
There are four companies (the names don't really matter) that are traded on the stock exchange. The player trades from his depot and the computer also draws, so there is movement in the market values. The output on the console uses the colors that are available. No special modules necessary.

## zahlenraten
A very simple script looking for a three digit number. Not all input errors are caught. The game is operated via the console and does not require a menu. The script chooses a random three-digit number between 111 and 999, the player enters three digits and learns whether his input is a hit, it is too high or too low. If successful, the script outputs the number of attempts and the time needed.

## lotto
Very simple lottery simulator 6 out of 49 with extra number. The random module is not very random.
Good luck.
